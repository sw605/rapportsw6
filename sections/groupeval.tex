\subsection{Multi-group project evaluation}
Throughout this semester, there has been a high focus collaborations between groups in the same multi-group project.
The collaboration effort consisted of two very important pieces; a weekly meeting where updates from all groups were made, and shared group rooms.
This made it so that there was time to discuss important decisions such as the structure of the core and licenses.
On the other side is community that sprouted from the shared group rooms where everyone was open and ready to help if needed.
If one group needed to speak to another indept about a certain, then they would quickly arrange that over our online communication tool; Slack.
Slack was a good choice since it is easy to create an user and there is bot intergrations, such as meeting reminders.

This enabled both quick meetings about simple things and indept discussions.
It was easy to ask questions, say that something is conserning, and arrange meetings, which helped a lot in the collaboration effort.

We had collaborations with a few groups such as the Freind Finder group about the color theme of the apps to get a similar feel between the \gls{astep} apps, and the User Management group about what user specific features were needed.

Our tightest collaboration was with the outdoor location based service (OD) group, as we developed and implemented our primary algorithm for them to implement.
During the project, we had several meetings with them where we would discuss what we would need from the API and how implementation should work to meet our needs.
In return they were conserned about performance and reducing very specific implementations in the \gls{astep} core.
We later on participated in an API test with OD, where they were interested in whether we would understand and be able to use the API.

We did not have as many collaborations as some of the \gls{astep} core groups had as we only requested functionality and they would then implement it.
But even then did we experience a better working environment\todo{better word} as we would have to meet hard\todo{better word} deadlines and we found communicating with the other groups very rewarding as we could share ideas and though.
 
We liked having less involvement in the core as it sometimes felt like there was a negative attitude towards people or groups who made small mistakes.

As it was new startup project, we would like if there would have been some kind of scrum master as we used scrum but no one managed it.
