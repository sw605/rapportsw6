\section{Multi-group project evaluation}
Throughout this semester there have been a high focus on working together with the other groups in the same multi-group project.
We have had a tight collaboration with outdoor location based service group as we developed and implemented our primary algorithm with them.
During the project we had several meetings with them where we would discuss what we, as an app group, would need from the API and how implementation should be done to satisfy our needs.
We participated in a API test with OD where we would try and explain if we would understand the API implementation on swagger.

We have had some collaboration with one of the other app groups, Friend Finder, to decide the color theme when designing the UI for the app.
We also discussed a few implementation orientated subjects, such as timestamps in the apps, to ensure we handled data the same way.

As we have used slack for communication for the entire multi-group project it have always been easy to contact the other groups asking questions or discussing small things that would not require a meeting.

We did not have as many collaborations as some of the \gls{astep} core groups had as we only requested functionality and they would then implement it.
But even then did we experience a better working environment\todo{better word} as we would have to meet hard\todo{better word} deadlines and we found communicating with the other groups very rewarding as we could share ideas and though.
 
We liked having less involvement in the core as it sometimes felt like there was a negative attitude towards people or groups who made small mistakes.

As it was new startup project, we would liked if there would have been some kind of scrum master as we used scrum but no one managed it.
