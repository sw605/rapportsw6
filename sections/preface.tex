The purpose of this report is to document the development process of the semester's project performed the spring of 2016 by our group, SW605F16.
This project was developed as part of the multi-group project \gls{astep}.
Throughout the project, we gained experience working with Android developmentm multi-group project collaboration, and much more.
The developed solution consists of three parts: an app, a server, and an \gls{astep} integration.
These cooperate and serve to provide app users with automatic ride sharing suggestions for their recurring driven routes, as a mean to reduce traffic, emissions and time.

We would like to thank Davide, our supervisor, for his work and support throughout the project, and Bin Yang for the multi-group project suggestion of \gls{astep}.
