The purpose of this report is to document the development and work process \todo{is work process an expression? would prefer 'work' -MP} of the semester project performed the spring of 2016 by our group, SW605F16.
This project was developed as part of the multi-group project \gls{astep}.
Throughout the project, we gained experience working with Android, Java Sockets, Http Requests, and multi-group project collaboration.
\todo{would empahasise multiproject. tech is not exiting. -MP}
The developed solution consists of three parts: an app, a server and an \gls{astep} integration.
These cooperate and serve to provide app users with automatic ride sharing suggestions for their recurring driven routes, as a mean to reduce traffic, emissions and time.

We would like to thank Davide, our supervisor, for his work and support throughout the project, and Bin Yang for the multi-group project suggestion of \gls{astep}.
