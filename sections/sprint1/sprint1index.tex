\chapter{Sprint 1}
The first sprint is concerned with getting the semester project started, including both the \gls{astep} project as a whole and the \gls{rs} project.
Thus, the first sprint will be spent on organizing the collaboration with the other project groups and setting the direction for the project.
This means that the contributing parts of sprint 1 will be the initial analysis, requirement specification and overall design, with the documentation in this chapter in the same order.
