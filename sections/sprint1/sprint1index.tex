\chapter{Sprint 1}
The first sprint concerns with getting the project started, both the aSTEP project as a whole as well as the ridesharing project described in this paper.
Thus in the first sprint there will be spent a lot of resources organizing the collaboration and setting the direction for the project.
This means that the two main contributing parts of sprint 1 will be respectively initial analysis and design.
