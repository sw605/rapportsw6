\subsubsection{Structual Design}
In the server, we need some way of manipulating and analysing routes.
This includes the route class itself and a way to promote the class to a stable route.

A StableRoute is a route which occurs on a regular basis, i.e. the probability of the user takeing that specific route after a predetermined time is high.
Currently, the app is focused on commuters that travels on a weekly basis.
