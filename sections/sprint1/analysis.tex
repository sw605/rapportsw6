\section{Analysis}
Ridesharing is an activity which have had different time of popularity in recent history according to Nelson D. Chan and Susan A. Shaheen\cite{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}.
The latests rise of popularity in ridesharing they attribute to the organizational capabilities of technologies such as the Internet and smartphones.
They also list insentiences for this phase of ridesharing which are as follows 
\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Focus on reducing climate change, growing dependence on foreign oil, and traffic congestion
  \item Partnerships between ridematching software companies and regions and large employers
  \item Financial incentives for green trips through sponsors
  \item Social networking platforms that target youth
  \item Real-time ridesharing services'' according to \cite{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}.
\end{itemize}

This present a broad overview of why ride sharing became popular again around 2014.
In the following section we analyze both academic papers as well as corporate and community products, to get a comprehension of the state of the art in the ridesharing field.

\subsection{Scholar Papers}
The problem of automating ridesharing though modern technology has already been studies by multiple scholars with different approaches, herein we briefly account for some of which we found most interesting and overlapping with our problem. 

In ``T-Share: A Large-Scale Dynamic Taxi Ridesharing Service'' \cite{ShuoMa2013} a solution for taxis picking up multiple passengers throughout a ride is developed and presented, seeking to increase the passenger throughput as well as lowering the distance traveled per passenger served.
Specifically interesting in aforementioned paper is an approach which suggest a grid representation of a map of a road network, this is to avoid shortest path calculations between points on a map, which is expensive, and instead approximate distance represented by cells in the grid.
The paper also, as well as most other services, utilize the users smartphone to collect location data and act as user interface.


\subsection{Private Solutions}
Concerning corporate and community solutions which exist these are quite different form the academic field.
Overall the big focus seems to be centered around taxi alternatives.
The two biggest international players in this field is Uber and Lyft.
There are also several services with some or all of their core focus in Denmark, most notable is services like Haxi and Drivr.
These service all works in similar ways; a customer request a ride through an smartphone app (or maybe a web interface), then the backed of the service sends the request to one or more appropriate drivers.
Since all of these services are commercial, actual information about the services design or architecture is not available.
Drivr seems to have to interesting feature in comparison to their opponents, that is a web system for respectively fleet management and business which provides administration and expense control of employee taxi travels.

In addition to these taxi like services there also exist services which focuses on traditional ridesharing between private people where money isn't earned, but expenses may be shared.
Again here exist both services which tries to reach internationally and services which is focuses on certian areas or countries.
These services are straightforward and offer the opportunity to either offer a lift, request a ride and the possibility to connect drivers and passengers.
These are usual free, however some of the services collect a small fee when connecting people.
