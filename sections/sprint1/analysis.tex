\section{Analysis}
Ridesharing is an activity which has had phases of popularity in recent history according to \citet{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}.
They describe the current phase as the technology-enabled ridematching phase which started in 2004.
In this phase, the intergration of the internet, mobile phones, and social media has into ridesharing services, reduces the barrier to entry for new potential passengers and drivers.
\citet{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557} also list incentives for ridesharing in the current phase, which are as follows 

\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Focus on reducing climate change, growing dependence on foreign oil, and traffic congestion
  \item Partnerships between ridematching software companies and regions and large employers
  \item Financial incentives for green trips through sponsors
  \item Social networking platforms that target youth
  \item Real-time ridesharing services'' \citep{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}.
\end{itemize}

This presents a broad overview of why ridesharing became popular again after 2004.
Because technologies play a vital role in the current phase a selection of popular commercial services will be examined a long with some scientific papers to get a comprehension of the state of the art in the field.
%The following section documents the analysis of both academic papers, as well as corporate and community products, to get a comprehension of the state of the art in the ridesharing field.
The main focus will be on real-time or dynamic ridesharing which \citet{amey2011real} defined as ``rideshare service relying heavily on mobile phone technologies''.

\subsection{Scientific Papers}
The problem of automating ridesharing through modern technology has already been studied by multiple scientists \todo{what?} with different approaches.
The following sections account for some of which we found the most interesting and relevant to the problem statement. 

\citet{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557, amey2011real} sees technology as one of the most important factors in the present and future of dynamic ridesharing.

\citet{ShuoMa2013} developed an algorthm for taxi services which improved throghput of passengers by 25\% and reduced the distance a single taxi had to drive by 13\% when there where there were six requests for rides per taxi. %  picking up many passengers throughout a ride is developed and presented, seeking to increase the passenger throughput as well as lowering the distance traveled per passenger served.
Especially interesting in their paper is an approach which suggests a grid representation of a road network, this is to avoid shortest path calculations between points on a map, and instead approximate distance represented by cells in the grid.
The paper also uses	 the user's smartphone to collect location data and act as a user interface.

\citet{ghoseiri2011real} researched what might matter when matching driver and passengers.
They focused on preferences which influence whether you want to drive with a person, this can be everything from gender to pet friendliness.
They developed functions which assesses whether a passenger and driver match, based on location, preferences, passenger and/or driver detour as the most important factors \cite{ghoseiri2011real}.
This algorithm might be useful in this project solution.

Actual choices and influences regarding algorithm design for ridematching will be addressed in the design phase. 

\subsection{Commercial Solutions}
Corporate and community solutions are quite different from the academic field.
The main focus seems to be centered around taxi alternatives.
The two biggest international services in this field as of 2016 is Uber and Lyft\todo{source}.
There are also several services with some or all of their focus in Denmark, most notable is services like Haxi and Drivr\todo{source}.
These services work in a similar way: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A customer request a ride through an smartphone app or a web interface
	\item The backend of the service sends the request to one or more appropriate drivers
\end{enumerate}

Since the mentioned services are commercial and closed-source, actual information about the services design or architecture is not available.
Drivr has two interesting feature in comparison to their opponents, that is a web system for fleet management and business which provides administration and expense control of employee taxi travels.

Besides these taxi like services, there also exist services which focus on traditional ridesharing between private people where money is not earned.
Again, here exist both local and international services. 
These services give the opportunity to either offer a lift, request a ride and the possibility to connect drivers and passengers.
These services are usually free, but some of them charge a small fee when connecting people.
Some of the more notable are GoMore and iRideshare.\todo{source}

The smartphones have automatized much of the labor concerning organizing ridesharing and act as a central component in all the analyzed systems\todo{what?}.
However, we still see an opportunity to use the smartphone even further in a service that arranges rides between users, thus decreasing the required labor.
