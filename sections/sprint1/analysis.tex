Sprint 1.

The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Learn when to stop. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.

Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.

Just use the old one inch brush. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?

You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.

Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. This piece of canvas is your world.
