\section{Design}\label{sprint1design}
% Metatext
This section contains the overall design of the app, which is based on the analysis in this sprint, with inspiration taken from the different commercial products and the papers read.
It will outline the main features of the design concerning system's structure, components, and the \arclong{ui}.

\subsection{System design}

\subsection{User Interface Design}
% General Introduction to UI - what + why
The \gls{ui} provides interaction methods between the user and the app.
As the priority of this project is functionality with regards to data collection and route generation and comparison, the \gls{ui} will not be developed together with users, nor allocated excessive resources. 
The \gls{ui} is developed for practical purposes, like testing, and to lay the basis for further development, but is still held to some standard which will be documented in the following text. 

\subsubsection{Design language}
% Definition
The design language is the general look and appearance of a system.
This is the foundation for the impressions and feels of the user and affects the user experience.
The design language is selected in collaboration with another aSTEP project group, SW604F16.

% Goals
The user interface is designed to achieve the following usability characteristics described by \citet{DIS2014}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learnability
	\item Utility
	\item Safety
	\item Effectiveness
\end{itemize}

% Material design
The \gls{ui} is designed to comply with the Google's Material design guidelines \cite{materialDesign}, being ``\textit{bold, graphic, intentional}''. 
Some of the Material design properties are stated in the following list, compiled of citations from the design guidelines \cite{materialProperties}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Material has varying x \& y dimensions (measured in dp) and a uniform thickness (1dp).
	\item Material casts shadows. Shadows result naturally from the relative elevation (z-position) between material elements.
	\item Content is displayed on material, in any shape and color. Content does not add thickness to material.
	\item Input events cannot pass through material.
	\item Material cannot pass through other material. For example, one sheet of material cannot pass through another sheet of material when changing elevation.
	\item Material grows and shrinks only along its plane.
	\item Material never bends or folds.
	\item Material can be spontaneously generated or destroyed anywhere in the environment.
\end{enumerate} 

% Paragraph regarding selection of material
Adhering the material design guidelines makes the app achieve a similar aesthetic and usage method as other apps in the Android eco-system. 
The design language aims to make the interface clean and simple, regarding colors and input methods.

\subsubsection{User interface}
% Actions in UI and design thereof
The design drafts in Figure \ref{fig:GUI-firstrun} reflect the necessary functions and the previously described design language. 

% Login and registering pages design
As the user needs a user profile in the \gls{astep} system to use the app, the users must be able to log in if they already have a user profile, and create a new user profile.

	\end{subfigure}
	 \caption{Draft of the views in the app.}\label{fig:GUI-firstrun}
\end{figure}

% In-app pages design
Several views are necessary to support the different parts of the app. 
The app needs views for login, registering, and presentation of matches as can be seen in the figures in Figure \ref{fig:GUI-firstrun}.

The application must be able to show matches in a separate view.
In this view, the user will be presented a list of other users which most likely are good matches. 
The users listed should be in a descending order, with the highest rated match at the top.
A short description of the users and match should be displayed, such as the user's full name, phone number, the match score, and what day(s) of the week the user drove the route and is expected to drive again.

This concludes the design of the app.
As mentioned before the \gls{ui} was not the main focus of the project and will therefore not be expanded further upon, for other than functional purposes.
