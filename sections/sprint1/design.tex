\section{Design}\label{sprint1design}
% Metatext
This section contains the overall app design, which is based on requirements with inspiration taken from the different commercial products and the papers read in the analysis.
The section will outline the main features of the design concerning system structure, components, and user interface.

\subsection{User Interface Design}
% General Introduction to UI - what + why
The \gls{ui} provides interaction methods between the user and the app.
As the priority of this project is functionality with regards to data collection and route generation and comparison, the \gls{ui} will not be developed together with users, nor allocated excessive resources. 
The \gls{ui} is developed for practical purposes, such as testing, and to lay the basis for further development, but is still held to a usable standard which will be documented in the following sections. 

\subsubsection{Design language}
% Definition
We consider the design language as the visual look and appearance of the app.
This is the foundation for the user impressions and affects the user experience.
The design language is selected in collaboration with another aSTEP project group, SW604F16.

% Goals
The user interface is designed to achieve the following usability characteristics described by \citet{DIS2014}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learnability
	\item Utility
	\item Safety
	\item Effectiveness
\end{itemize}

% Material design
The \gls{ui} is designed to comply with the Google's Material design guidelines \cite{materialDesign}, being ``\textit{bold, graphic, intentional}''. 
We consider Material Design to be a nice modern design framework, and it is the recommended design language to use in android applications, by Google\cite{materialProperties}. 

% Paragraph regarding selection of material
Adhering the material design guidelines makes the app achieve a similar aesthetic and usage method as other apps in the Android eco-system. 
The design language aims to make the interface clean and simple, regarding colors and input methods.

\subsubsection{User interface}
% Actions in UI and design thereof
This section contains design drafts of the user interface style and functionality.
The design drafts in Figure \ref{fig:GUI-firstrun} reflect the necessary functions and the previously described design language. 

% Login and registering pages design
As the user needs a user profile in the \gls{astep} system to use the app, the users must be able to log in if they have a user profile, and create a new user profile if they are not already registered.

	\end{subfigure}
	 \caption{Draft of the views in the app.}\label{fig:GUI-firstrun}
\end{figure}

% In-app pages design
Several views are necessary to support the different parts of the app. 
The app needs views for login, registering, and presentation of matches as can be seen in the figures in Figure \ref{fig:GUI-firstrun}.

The application must be able to show matches in a separate view.
In this view, the user will be presented a list of other users which most likely are good matches. 
The list of user matches should be in a descending order, with the highest rated match at the top.
A short description of the users and match should be displayed, such as the user's full name, phone number, the match score, and what day(s) of the week the user drove the route and is expected to drive again.

This concludes the design of the app.
As earlier mentioned, the \gls{ui} is not the main focus of the project and will therefore not be further developed for other than functional purposes.
