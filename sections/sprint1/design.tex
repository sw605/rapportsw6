% Metatext
The temporary design is based on the preliminary analysis of sprint 1, and will outline the main features of the design, concerning system structure and components, and the user interface.

\subsection{User Interface Design}
% General Introduction to UI - what + why
The user interface (UI) provides interaction methods between the user and the app.
As the priority of this project is functionality with regards to data collection and route generation and comparison, the UI will not be developed together with users, nor allocated excessive resources. 
The UI is developed for practical purposes, like testing, and to lay the basis for further development, but is still held to some standard which will be documented in the following text. 

\subsubsection{Design language}
% Definition
The design language is the general look and appearance of a system.
This is the foundation for the impressions and feels of the user, and affects the user experience.
The design language is selected in collaboration with another aSTEP project group, SW604F16.

% Goals
The user interface is designed to achieve the following usability characteristics \cite{DIS2014}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learnability
	\item Utility
	\item Safety
	\item Effectiveness
\end{itemize}

% Material design
The UI is designed to comply with the Google's Material design guidelines \cite{materialDesign}, being ``\textit{bold, graphic, intentional}''. 
Some of the Material design properties are stated in the following list, compiled of citations from the design guidelines \cite{materialProperties}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Material has varying x \& y dimensions (measured in dp) and a uniform thickness (1dp).
	\item Material casts shadows. Shadows result naturally from the relative elevation (z-position) between material elements.
	\item Content is displayed on material, in any shape and color. Content does not add thickness to material.
	\item Input events cannot pass through material.
	\item Material cannot pass through other material. For example, one sheet of material cannot pass through another sheet of material when changing elevation.
	\item Material grows and shrinks only along its plane.
	\item Material never bends or folds.
	\item Material can be spontaneously generated or destroyed anywhere in the environment.
\end{enumerate} 

% Paragraph regarding selection of material
Adhering the material design guidelines makes the app achieve a similar aesthetic and usage method as other apps in the Android eco-system. 
The design language aims to make the interface clean and simple, regarding colors and input methods.

\subsubsection{User interface}
% Actions in UI and design thereof
The design drafts in Figure \ref{fig:GUI-firstrun} reflect the necessary functions and the previously described design language. 

% Login and registering pages design
As the user needs a user profile in the aSTEP system to use the app, the users must be able to login if they already have a user profile, or create a new user profile.

\end{figure}

% In-app pages design
Several screens are necessary to support the different parts of the app. 
The app needs a screen for login, registering, presentation of matches, and a settings screen, as can be seen in the figures in Figure \ref{fig:GUI-in-app}.

As the application must have communication to the aSTEP server, which have an requirement of registration of users, it is necessary to have a register and login screen in the application. The username will be used as a identifier for the user, and it will be used both for the aSTEP server, but also for the application it self. It will be the identifier to differ between each user, and ensure users are matched up with other users correctly when comparing routes.

The application must have a main screen, and it is chosen that should be the route match list. On this screen the user will be presented a list of other users, which most likely is a good match. The users listed should be in an descending order, with the highest rated match at the top. A short description about the users and match should be displayed, such as the users full name, phone number, the match score, and what day of the week the user drive the relevant route.

A settings screen is needed because the users should have the option to change there initial information from when they registered. The settings screen also server as a screen where users can specify their preferences. Such information is, wherever the users have a car with X amout of seats and if the users is looking for, or giving a lift.
In addition should there exist a navigation drawer from where the user can navigate around the application.
