}{% the abstract
This project was developed as part of a multi-group project with the goal to develop a platform for spatial and temporal data management (aSTEP) with accompanying apps.

Our task was to develop an application (\acrshort{rs}) which utilizes aSTEP to suggest rideshare partners to users by storing gathered GPS data and analyzing users routes.
For this, we developed an algorithm that compares two routes and returns a score based on our estimation of the potential for ridesharing.

The solution is in an acceptable state but needs a user interface refinement and a large-scale test to confirm the matching algorithm is working as intended for a bigger user basis.
