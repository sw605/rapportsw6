\section{Reflection}
% metatext
This section contains our reflection of the different project aspects.
First, the project content and system design and implementation will be discussed.
Second, the work distribution and project process is described.

% project conten and system design/implementation
The system design was influenced by the \gls{astep} progression during the development.
Throughout the project time period, there were multiple changes in the \gls{astep} system, and they had different impact on our project.
Most significant was the change from \gls{astep} storing supplemental user information, such as e-mail address, to not providing other information than username and password.
The system design could have been better and there would be more time for implementation if the \gls{astep} system design had a static design from the beginning.

% project process and work distribution
The implementation was successful and dynamic, adjusting to changes made in the \gls{astep} project and our own tests performed in the iterations, in accordance with the iterative method.
All project members were somewhat included in every project project part.
Each member had a possibility to discuss the individual parts, despite being assigned to another part during that time period.
The tasks were evenly distributed on the group members, and more complex tasks were assigned two members, where necessary.

% project work load
We were ambitious with the extent of the project, therein objectives regarding custom user settings of having a car or not, despite the project leader Bin Yang proposed low ambition levels and just making a working basis.
Our ambition level is reflected in the requirement specification,
