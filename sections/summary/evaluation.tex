\chapter{Summary}
This summary chapter contains the reflection, conclusion and further work.

\section{Reflection}
This section contains our reflection of the different project aspects.
First our own project reflection is reflected upon, then the multi-group project is reflected upon and evaluated.

\subsection{Project Reflection}
% metatext
First, the project content and system design and implementation will be discussed.
Second, the work distribution and project process is described.

% project conten and system design/implementation
The system design was influenced by the \gls{astep} progression during the development.
Throughout the project time period, there were multiple changes in the \gls{astep} system, and they had different impact on our project.
Most significant was the change from \gls{astep} storing supplemental user information, such as e-mail address, to not providing other information than username and password.
The system design could have been better and there would be more time for implementation if the \gls{astep} system design had a static design from the beginning.

% project process and work distribution
The implementation was successful and dynamic, adjusting to changes made in the \gls{astep} project and our own tests performed in the iterations, in accordance with the iterative method.
All project members were somewhat included in every project project part.
Each member had a possibility to discuss the individual parts, despite being assigned to another part during that time period.
The tasks were evenly distributed on the group members, and more complex tasks were assigned two members, where necessary.

% project work load
We were ambitious with the extent of the project, therein objectives regarding custom user settings of having a car or not, despite the project leader Bin Yang proposed low ambition levels and just making a working basis.
Our ambition level is reflected in the requirement specification, and as seen in the acceptance test in Section \ref{sec:s4test}, only the 'must have' requirements are fulfilled.
The work load during the project has been high, while there has been a joint attitude of making the solution as requirement fulfilling as possible.
The ambition level and the established requirement specification together with unexpected task completion durations have caused delays during the sprints, so that actual deadlines were not met.
This happened during sprint 2 and 3, where each was two weeks past the multi-group project deadlines.
The missed deadlines had no effect on the \gls{astep} project, and only made our own scheduling harder to meet.


The \gls{rs} app is a functional prototype, and with reference to Bin Yang's statement regarding low ambitions, the project is seen as a success.
