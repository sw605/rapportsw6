\chapter{Summary}
This summary chapter contains the reflection, conclusion and further work.

\section{Reflection}
This section contains our reflection of the different project aspects.
First our own project reflection is reflected upon, then the multi-group project is reflected upon and evaluated.

\subsection{Project Reflection}
% project conten and system design/implementation
The system design was influenced by the \gls{astep} progression during the development as the system relied on \gls{astep}.
Throughout the project, there were multiple changes in the \gls{astep} system, and they had different impacts on our project.
Most significant was the change from \gls{astep} storing supplemental user information, such as e-mail address, to not storing anything other than username and password.
The system design could have been better and there would be more time for implementation if the \gls{astep} system design had a static design\todo{Hvad er et statis design? - Corlin} from the beginning.

% project process and work distribution
The implementation was successful and dynamic, adjusting to changes made in the \gls{astep} project and our own tests performed in the iterations, in accordance with the iterative method.
All group members were included in every part of the project.
Each member had a possibility to discuss the individual parts, despite being assigned to another part during that time period.
The tasks were evenly distributed on the group members, and more complex tasks were assigned to multiple members, where necessary.

% project work load
We were ambitious with the extent of the project, therein objectives regarding custom user settings of having a car or not, despite the project leader Bin Yang proposed low ambition levels and just making a working basis.
Our ambition level is reflected in the requirement specification, and as seen in the acceptance test in Section \ref{sec:s4test}, only the 'must have' requirements are fulfilled.
The workload during the project has been high while there has been a joint attitude of making the solution as requirement-fulfilling as possible.
The ambition level and the established requirement specification together with unexpected task completion durations have caused delays during the sprints so that actual deadlines were sometimes not met.
This happened during sprint 2 and 3, where our internal deadline would extend two weeks past the multi-group project deadlines.
The missed deadlines had no effect on the \gls{astep} project and only made our own scheduling harder to meet.


The \gls{rs} app is a functional prototype, and is seen as a success since it utilized the \gls{astep} system.
