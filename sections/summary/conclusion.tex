\section{Conclusion}
% meta and contin. of introduction
The \gls{rs} solution, consisting of an Android application accommodated by an assisting server, utilizing the \gls{astep} system was developed in this project.
The \gls{astep} system was developed concurrently with the \gls{rs} solution, and both systems were dependent upon each other to be expedient.

% conclusion on working process and cooperation



% conclusion on the solution
The solution fulfills the established requirements regarding both functionality and cooperation with the other semester project groups, as stated in the test in Section \ref{sec:s4test}.


% conclusion on the problem statement
The project has been focused on the problem statement\\
\todo{insert problem statement}

The problem statement has been the initiating factor of the development process, and was assigned\todo{find better word} a set of requirements.
While the 'Must have' requirements are fulfilled, there are still remaining requirements regarding parts of the solution that are not completed.
However, the 'Must have' requirements were sufficiently covering the minimum level of functionality\todo{find synonym?}, and hence the problem statement is fulfilled and the solution is considered successfully accomplished.


% final conclusion
The semester project, solution, and the multi-group project lays the foundation for a potentially comprehensive location based service for both indoor and outdoor positioning.
Although the \gls[rs] app could benefit from a user interface redesign in terms of aesthetics, it solves the problem statement and can be applied in the real world.
