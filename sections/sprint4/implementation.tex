\section{Implementation}
% meta
This section contains documentation of the implementation of the designs described in the previous section regarding the solution status.
First, the \gls{rs} server implementation is described, followed by the description of the app to \gls{astep} communication implementation.

\subsection{\gls{rs} App}
The app is further improved upon in this sprint.
While the implementation of UI is considered trivial, it is not documented in detail in the report.
The app is updated so that the route match users stored in the \gls{rs} server are shown in the user interface at the main screen.
The user matches are displayed similarly as in the prototype design of the app.
