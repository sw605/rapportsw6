This section contains descriptions of the analysis performed in sprint 4.

\subsection{Missing features for completing the solution}
The \gls{rs} solution has currently, successfully implemented the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{rs} App
	\subitem Background location gathering and caching
	\subitem \gls{astep} Login
	\subitem Push routes to \gls{astep}
	\item \gls{astep}
	\subitem Algorithm matches routes
	\subitem Automatically determine regular routes
	\subitem Matching routes where one is a subroute
	\item \gls{rs} Server
	\subitem Database to store supplementary user data
\end{itemize} 

However, there are still parts to implement according to the requirements.
The missing features seen in the 'must have' category are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Display matches to user
	\item User registration
\end{itemize}
