\section{Analysis}
% analysis metatext
This section contains descriptions of the analysis performed in sprint 4.
The analysis is performed to evaluate the current status of the solution, and hence enabling the further development on the solution parts.
The status is considered with regards to the previously performed tests and the requirement specification, so that the solution can fulfill the requirements, be usable and finally pass an acceptance test.
The analysis is divided into three sections, each dedicated to one of the three main parts of the solution.

\subsection{Missing features for completing the solution}
The \gls{rs} solution has currently, successfully implemented the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{rs} App
	\subitem Background location gathering and caching
	\subitem \gls{astep} Login
	\subitem Push routes to \gls{astep}
	\item \gls{astep}
	\subitem Algorithm matches routes
	\subitem Automatically determine regular routes
	\subitem Matching routes where one is a subroute
	\item \gls{rs} Server
	\subitem Database to store supplementary user data
\end{itemize} 

However, there are still parts to implement according to the requirements.
The missing features seen in the 'must have' category are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Display matches to user
	\item User registration
\end{itemize}
\fi


\subsection{\gls{astep}}
The only part of the \gls{astep} controlled by the \gls{rs} solution is the algorithm, and it is tested and evaluated as functional, according to Section \ref{sec:s3algtest}. However, the \gls{astep} must be tested to check that the \gls{rs} complies with the requirements in the API.

\subsection{\gls{rs} Server}
The \gls{rs} server is currently missing, but its functionality and position in the \gls{rs} solution is described in the previous sprints \todo{add reference}.
The server fulfills the requirement of storing contact information for the users, as this is not provided by the \gls{astep} system.

Additionally, the \gls{rs} server fetches the generated matches from \gls{astep} system and stores them, enabling the \gls{rs} app to display the matches to their respective users.

Because the \gls{rs} server is sufficiently described previously, there will be no further analysis of the server requirements.

\subsection{\gls{rs} App}
The visual \gls{rs} app interface is currently consisting of a static, temporary placeholder list of two fictitious matches, and an empty settings menu.

The app needs to provide actual route matches and a login system to be usable.
The matches should be provided by the \gls{rs} server.
