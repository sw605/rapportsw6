\section{Solution Status Analysis}
% analysis metatext
This section contains descriptions of the analysis performed in sprint 4.
The analysis is performed to evaluate and review the current status of the solution, and hence enabling the further development on the solution parts.

The status is considered with regards to the previously performed tests and the requirement specification, so that the solution can fulfill the requirements and pass an acceptance test.
The analysis is divided into three sections, each dedicated to one of the three main parts of the solution.

The solution is well analysed throughout the previous sprint analyses, and the necessary features are outlined in their respective sprints.
The current analysis will be focused on revealing the lacking implementation of high prioritized requirements from the MoSCoW analysis performed in sprint 1, rather than analysing new material.


\subsection{\gls{astep}}
The only part of the \gls{astep} controlled by the \gls{rs} solution is the algorithm, and it is tested and evaluated as functional, according to Section \ref{subsec:algotest}. 
However, the \gls{astep} must be tested to check that the \gls{rs} system satisfy the correct implementation of the API.
No further development is currently considered necessary for the \gls{astep} part of the solution.
%Potential failures in the \gls{astep} communication could be caused by poor implementation in the \gls{rs} app or in the \gls{astep} system, or by poor cooperation or misunderstanding between the project groups.


\subsection{\gls{rs} Server}
The \gls{rs} server is currently not functional, but its functionality and position in the \gls{rs} solution is analysed and designed in the previous sprints, e.g. in system design in Section \ref{sec:s2systemdesign}. Because the \gls{rs} server is sufficiently described previously, there will be no further analysis of the server requirements.

The server must fulfill the requirement of storing contact information for the users, as this is not provided by the \gls{astep} system.
Additionally, the \gls{rs} server needs to fetch the calculated matches from \gls{astep} system and stores them locally on the server, enabling the \gls{rs} app to display the matches to their respective users.


\subsection{\gls{rs} App}
The visual \gls{rs} app interface is currently consisting of a static, temporary placeholder list of two fictitious matches, and an empty settings menu.
The match interface needs to be implemented to comply with the requirement of displaying matches to the user. Furthermore, to separate user accounts and fulfill the requirement regarding login, the login interface and functionality must be implemented.
