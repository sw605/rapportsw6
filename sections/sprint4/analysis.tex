\section{Solution Status Analysis}
% analysis metatext
This section contains descriptions of the analysis performed in sprint 4.
The analysis is performed to evaluate and review the current status of the solution, and hence enabling the further development of the solution parts.

The status is considered with regards to the requirement specification and the previously performed tests so that the solution can fulfill the requirements and pass an acceptance test.
The analysis is divided into three sections, each dedicated to one of the three main parts of the solution.

The solution is analyzed throughout the previous sprints' analyses, and the necessary features are outlined in their respective sprints.
The current analysis will be focused on revealing the lacking implementation of high prioritized requirements from the MoSCoW analysis performed in sprint 1, rather than analysing new material.


\subsection{\gls{astep}}

The only part of \gls{astep} that is specialized to the requirements of the \gls{rs} project is the algorithm, and it is tested and evaluated as functional, according to Section \ref{subsec:algotest}. 
However, communication between \gls{astep} and the \gls{rs} system must be tested to ensure a correct implementation of the API.
No further development is currently considered necessary for the \gls{astep} part of the solution.
%Potential failures in the \gls{astep} communication could be caused by poor implementation in the \gls{rs} app or in the \gls{astep} system, or by poor cooperation or misunderstanding between the project groups.


\subsection{\gls{rs} Server}
The \gls{rs} server is currently not functional, but its functionalities and position in the \gls{rs} solution are analyzed and designed in the previous sprints, e.g. in system design in Section \ref{sec:s2systemdesign}. Because the \gls{rs} server is sufficiently described in previous sections, there will be no further analysis of the server requirements.

The server must fulfill the requirement of storing contact information for the users, as this is not provided by the \gls{astep} system itself.
Additionally, the \gls{rs} server needs to fetch the calculated matches from \gls{astep} system and store them locally on the server, enabling the \gls{rs} app to display the matches to their respective users.


\subsection{\gls{rs} App}
The visual interface of the \gls{rs} app is currently consisting of a static, temporary placeholder list of two fictitious matches and an empty settings menu.
The match interface needs to be implemented to comply with the requirement of displaying matches to the user. 
Furthermore, to separate user accounts and fulfill the requirement regarding login, the login interface and functionality must be implemented.
