\section{Test}
% metatext for test section
This section will contain descriptions and documentation of the tests performed on the whole \gls{rs} solution in the fourth sprint.
The tests are the final tests on the solution, and will serve as a full system test and as the basis for the solution and project evaluation.
The tests are distributed into categories of the different parts in the solution: vertices(things) and edges(communication).


\subsection{RideShare App}
\textbf{Background location gathering}\\
The background location caching test was performed in sprint 3, and was assessed fully functional.

\textbf{Display matches to user}\\
currently no.
not fulfilled requirement.


\subsection{aSTEP}
Our contribution to the \gls{astep} system was the pseudocode for the algorithm.
The algorithm was tested in sprint 3 and evaluated as sufficient for the solution, although missing a more comprehensive test with actual user routes.


\subsection{RideShare Server}
\textbf{some category tested}\\
work quite well, preferably.

\textbf{another tested category}\\
assumed working!


\subsection{App - aSTEP Communication}
\textbf{Route push}\\
works

\textbf{Register new user}\\
works

\textbf{Login}\\
works. receiving token. real nice.


\subsection{RideShare Server - aSTEP Communication}
The action performed between the \gls{rs} server and \gls{astep} is to receive route matches.
It works as intended.


\subsection{App - RideShare Server Communication}
\textbf{Get matches}\\
The \gls{rs} app receives matches goodly.

\textbf{Store extra data to new user}\\
is it done?
