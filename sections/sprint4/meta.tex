This chapter is containing the documentation of the work performed in sprint 4.
This is the last iteration and sprint of the project, thus the sprint is focused on completing the solution and fulfilling the missing high priority requirements.

The documentation is structured chronologically, and starts with the analysis of the not yet fulfilled requirements.
Thereafter, the design section contains descriptions of the solution design for the necessary parts.
Next, the implementation of the design is documented.
The chapter ends with a test of the whole solution, as the development is stopped, and a status check is needed to evaluate the project and solution.
