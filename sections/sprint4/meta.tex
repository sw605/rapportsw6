Sprint 4 is the last iteration of the project.
The sprint is therefore focused on completing the solution and fulfilling the missing high priority requirements.

The documentation is structured chronologically, and starts with the analysis of the not yet fulfilled requirements.
Thereafter, the design section contains descriptions of the solution design for the necessary parts.
Next, the implementation of the design is documented.
The chapter ends with a test of the whole solution, as the development is stopped, and a status check is needed to evaluate the project and solution.
