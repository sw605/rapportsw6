\subsection{Algorithm}\label{ssec:algorithm}
The \gls{rs} system uses a custom developed algorithm to determine whether two routes are a good match.
This algorithm is loosely based on a simplified version of \citet{ghoseiri2011real}, with regards to the process of the evaluation of a match.
In the paper, the algorithm considers multiple aspects when assessing matches, such as smoking, gender and age preferences.
The criteria are practical to some extent, but the focus of the \gls{rs} system is the time and distance criteria, and hence the other criteria are discarded.

This paragraph contains definitions to clarify the terms used in this section. A position is spatial-temporal, whereas a location is a spatial point and a time is a temporal point.
A route is a chronologically sorted list of positions.

To illustrate how the algorithm is supposed to work for different routes an example is introduced. The example can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:algEx1}.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
\input{figures/algorithmEx1.tex}
    \caption{Alice, Bob, Carol and Eve's stable routes. Each grid represent a 5$\times$5 km area.}
    \label{fig:algEx1}
\end{figure}
The example introduces four users, each with one stable route in this example. In addition to the location of their routes, we also have their departure and arrival times that can be seen in Table \ref{timetable}.
\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{User} & \textbf{Departure} & \textbf{Arrival} & \textbf{Distance} 	\\ \midrule
Alice         & 07:20                   & 07:55       & 36.5 km 			\\
Bob           & 07:35                   & 07:50       & 14 km  		  		\\
Carol         & 08:05                   & 08:30       & 15 km         		\\
Eve           & 07:30                   & 07:50       & 18 km         		\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The four users departure and arrival times as well as their distances.}
\label{timetable}
\end{table}

For this example, the goal will be to find out if any route matches with Alice's route $\{A_s,A_g\}$.
The outcome is a score representing if Alice, on the way through route $r$, should pick up some of the persons Bob, Carol or Eve, for each of their routes.

The expected outcome is Bob will match reasonable in both distance and time difference and hence be given a score indicating a match.
Carol is expected to match reasonable in distance as well but will lack a match comparing travel times and therefore not produce a match.
Comparing with Eve a somewhat match on time is expected while the distance will be insufficient.
The score represents the match of the routes of Alice and each of the other, and should be expressed as a decimal value from 0 to 1 which tells how good the match is.
0 represents a bad match, a major detour or not compatible times, and 1 represents a perfect match, and requires no detour.
A comparison will be made for $r_1$ against $r_2$.
To summarize, the algorithm takes a route $r$ and two positions to compare against; start ($s$), and goal ($g$) as arguments.
The algorithm then returns a decimal value between 0 and 1.

\subsubsection{Time Distance Analyzer Algorithm}
There are two aspects to be evaluated in the algorithm: time and distance.
These are assumed to be evaluated by two sub algorithms that both takes the route and two points as input and return a value from 0 to 1 describing how closely they match.

If either time or distance is assessed unacceptable they are being assessed a score of 0, thus the whole match is unacceptable and given the a final score of 0.
From the scores of the sub algorithms, the final score can be expressed as the average score $\frac{d+t}{2}$, where $d$ is the distance score and $t$ is the time score.
To increase flexibility of the algorithm, two constants are introduced $d_\gamma$ and $t_\gamma$.
These constants enables weighting of the time and distance score independent of each other by expanding the expression to $\frac{d\times d_\gamma+t\times t_\gamma}{d_\gamma+t_\gamma}$.

For our example we simply set both $d_\gamma$ and $t_\gamma$ to 1. 

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Time Distance Analyzer Pseudocode}
	\label{alg:timedistanalyser}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require 
		\Statex let $d_\gamma$ be the modifier for distance in $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$
		\Statex let $t_\gamma$ be the modifier for time in $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$
		\Statex 
		\Function{TimeDistanceAnalyzer}{$r, s, g$}
			\State $d\gets$\Call{DistanceAnalyzer}{$r, s, g$}
			\State $t\gets$\Call{TimeAnalyzer}{$r, s, g$}
			
			\If{$d > 0 \wedge t > 0$}
				\State \Return $\frac{d\times d_\gamma+t\times t_\gamma}{d_\gamma+t_\gamma}$
			\Else
				\State\Return 0
			\EndIf
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The time distance analyzer can be seen in Algorithm \ref{alg:timedistanalyser}.
Line 2 and 3 are calls to the algorithms that solve the subproblems of scoring the time and location, and line 4 to 8 is the logic described in the previous paragraph.

The following sections will cover the sub algorithms.
First, the distance analyzer algorithm will be described, followed by the time analyzer algorithm.

\subsubsection{Distance analyzer}
The distance analyzer algorithm takes a route and two end points and assesses the score for the detour when only considering the distance.
To accomplish this, it is required to define how long the longest acceptable detour should be.
The algorithm also needs a way of calculating the distance between two discrete locations, which can be performed by the function for euclidean distances.
This leads to the following algorithm, where the symbol $\mathbb{L}$ is used to denote the set of all possible locations:

\begin{align*}
	dist : \mathbb{L}\times\mathbb{L} &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\\
	a, b &\mapsto \sqrt{(a_{latitude} - b_{latitude})^2 + (a_{longitude} - b_{longitude})^2}
\end{align*}

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Distance Analyzer pseudocode}
	\label{alg:distanalyser}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require 
		\Statex let $\beta$ be the largest acceptable detour length in $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ 
		\Statex 
		\Function{DistanceAnalyzer}{$r, s, g$}
			\State let $r_s$ be the closest point to $s$ in $r$
			\State let $r_g$ be the closest point to $g$ in $r$
			\State $d_s\gets dist(r_s, s)$\Comment Pickup detour distance
			\State $d_g\gets dist(r_g, g)$\Comment Set off detour distance
			\State\Return $1-\frac{d_s + d_g}{\beta}$
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

A disadvantage of the algorithm presented here is that the distance is calculated as a euclidean distance rather than a road distance. 
This would be a obvious place for future improvements to the algorithm.

The distance analyzer algorithm, as seen in Algorithm \ref{alg:distanalyser}, finds the points on the route that are closest to the start and end points.
From those points, the algorithm approximates the detour required to take by the driver to pick up the passenger.
The approximation assumes that the driver's new route distance will be the original length plus the distances to the passengers start point and goal point.
This assumption does not represent the actual detour and thus this is an area for future optimization.

The final score for the distance analyzer is calculated by taking the total detour length and dividing it by the length of the largest acceptable detour.
This results in a value between 0 and 1 when the detour is less than the largest detour, and greater than one when the detour is longer.
The value is inverted by subtracting it from 1 to make better scores greater values, as required by Algorithm \ref{alg:timedistanalyser}.
If the value is greater than the acceptable detour length, the inversion in the return statement will generate a negative value, hence causing Algorithm \ref{alg:timedistanalyser} to return a result representing no match.

In the example introduced in the beginning of this chapter, the longest detour is set to be 25\% of Alice's total commute and Alice's route is modeled as the line  $y = \frac{4}{7}-\frac{2 x}{7}$.
It is assumed that Alice's route have tracking points continuously in the line, and therefore a line to point distance calculation is used in this example, this means $r_s$ and $r_g$ will be calculated simultaneously as the distance is calculated.
This gives the the results showed in Table \ref{tbl:distance} when applying the distance  Algorithm \ref{alg:distanalyser}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{User} 	& \textbf{$d_s$} & \textbf{$d_g$} 	& \textbf{return value} 	\\ \midrule
Bob         	& 3.57 km        & 1.85 km	    	& 0.550		 			\\
Carol         	& 4.12 km        & 0 km       		& 0.609        		\\
Eve           	& 9.62 km        & 4.12 km		    & -0.505        		\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The detour distance for Alice compared to the other users as well as the score of the Distance Analyzer for each route.}
\label{tbl:distance}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tbl:distance} presents the results for the distance analyzer.
The algorithm assesses the best results for Carol, followed by Bob while Carol yields a negative result since Alice's detour becomes longer than the acceptable 25\%. 


\subsubsection{Time analyzer}
The time analyzer algorithm works similarly to the distance analyzer algorithm. 
It is also designed to take two points and a route as input and to return a score representing the time differences.

When determining time difference two things should be taken into consideration; the detour duration and the existing differences in time.
The detour duration can be approximated by multiplying the detour distance with the time it takes to travel a distance unit.

Each position in each driver's route has a timestamp for when the location was visited.
This can be used to determine the relative time distance between two points by using the following function:
\begin{align*}
	time : \mathbb{L}\times\mathbb{L} &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\\
	a, b &\mapsto | a_{time} - b_{time} |
\end{align*}

The calculated detour time and relative time difference enables an approximation of the inconvenience the ridesharing is for the participants in the potential match.
From the driver's perspective, the route starts at the normal time minus the detour duration, to still arrive on the usual time at the destination.
This makes the detour the only inconvenience in regards to time.
If the passenger has to arrive earlier than the driver, the driver would also need to take that into consideration, thus making the relative time distance the inconvenience in addition to the detour.

From the passenger's perspective, the opposite is true when it comes to the relative time. 
It is only an inconvenience when the driver must set them off before they need to arrive. It is also worth noting that if the relative time is the same as the detour time, the only inconvenience for the driver is the detour.

The formula for the total inconvenience when taking both participants into account is then defined as the following:

\[ |d - t| + d \]

where $d$ is the detour time and $t$ is the relative time.

\iffalse
Now, let us consider what would happen on the return route.
The situation is now that the driver and passenger want to return to their original locations, but they want to leave at a specific time.
The algorithm already solves this because if a specific arrival time is defined a specific departure time must also be defined.
And the differences in time must be the same.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Time Analyzer pseudocode}
	\label{alg:timeanalyser}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require 
		\Statex let $\delta$ be the acceptable time difference in $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$
		\Statex let $\gamma$ be the translation from distance to time in $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ 
		\Statex 
		\Function{TimeAnalyzer}{$r, s, g$}
			\State let $r_s$ be the closest point to $s$ in $r$
			\State let $r_g$ be the closest point to $g$ in $r$
			\State $d \gets (dist(r_s,s) + dist(r_g,g))\times\gamma$\Comment{The total detour time}
			\State $t \gets max(time(r_s, s), time(r_g, g))$\Comment{The largest time difference}
			\State\Return $1-\frac{|d - t| + d}{\delta}$
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm \ref{alg:timeanalyser} shows the pseudocode for the time analyzer algorithm.
Line 2 to 4 are reminiscent of line 2 to 5 in Algorithm \ref{alg:distanalyser} with the difference that they sum the detours and multiplies the result with the distance to time conversion.
Line 5 assigns the greatest time difference between the closest points to $t$.
The reason for choosing the greatest value is to use a pessimistic approach, so that the real delay will not be worse than the calculated.

For the Alice example, defining the speed as constant through the whole route is preferable to keep the example more simple.
Alice travels 36.5 km in 35 minutes, this gives a pace of  $\frac{35 min}{36.5 km} = 0.959\frac{min}{km} $.
For this example the acceptable time difference is set to 15 minutes $\delta = 15$.
The time analyzer algorithm is applied to the example with the aforementioned data, the result can be seen in Table \ref{tbl:time}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{User} 	& \textbf{$d$} & \textbf{$t$} 	& \textbf{return value} \\ \midrule
Bob         	& 5m:12s       & 3m			    & 0.63				\\
Carol         	& 3m:57s       & 35m	      	& -0.75       		\\
Eve           	& 13m:11s      & 18m			& 0.10        		\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The detour time and time difference for Alice compared to the other users as well as the score of the TimeAnalyzer for each route.}
\label{tbl:time}
\end{table}
 
In the results from the example in Table \ref{tbl:time}, it can be seen that Bob receives a relatively high score, while Carol's score is below zero, and Eve is just within the acceptable range. 

With the scores from the two subalgorithms, Algorithm \ref{alg:timedistanalyser} is able to assess the matches' final scores.
The final results of the algorithm example can be seen in Table \ref{tbl:timedist}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{User} 	& \textbf{$d$} & \textbf{$t$} 	& \textbf{return value} \\ \midrule
Bob         	& 0.550 	   & 0.63		    & 0.59					\\
Carol         	& 0.609        & -0.75	      	& 0       				\\
Eve           	& -0.505       & 0.10			& 0        				\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The result for Alice's match compatibility to the other users calculated by the Time Distance Analyzer.}
\label{tbl:timedist}
\end{table}

The results in Table \ref{tbl:timedist} shows that with the set detour limits in distance and time the only compatible match for Alice is Bob with a score of $0.59$. 
Although Carol scores acceptable in the distance analyzer, the time difference is unacceptable thus assessed a score of $0$.
Eve scores below 0 in the distance parameter and is therefore also given a final score of $0$.

The two modifiers $d_\gamma$ and $t_\gamma$ were set to $1$ in this example, but these modifiers, along with the acceptable detours in time and distance, can be adjusted to adapt scores if the given outputs do not reflect the expected outcomes or the users' actual willingness to share rides in a given situation. 

\subsubsection{Complexity}
Considering the complexity of the three algorithms, the Time Distance Analyzer complexity is only dependent on the calls on lines 2 and 3, while the rest of the algorithm is input independent.
Line 2-3 are the calls to the two sub algorithms.

In the Distance Analyzer Algorithm \ref{alg:distanalyser} line 2 and 3 is where the whole route should be iterated through, the complexity of this sub algorithm is $O(|r|)$ where $|r|$ is the number of positions in route $r$.
Line 4 to 6 perform arithmetic operations that run in constant time, and can be ignored when describing the asymptotic notation.

For Time Analyzer the complexity is the same as in Distance Analyzer because of the similarity of the first few lines and the last lines are simple arithmetic operations. 
The exceptions are $dist$, $time$, and $max$. 
$time$ and $dist$, which both are described earlier, are considered to be $O(1)$ operations.
$max$ takes two values, compares them and returns the largest of the two.
This is also a constant operation, and hence we can determine that the Time Analyzer algorithm is $O(|r|)$.

Thus we have that the main algorithm is $O(|r|)$, the number of locations in a route, for each stable route in the \gls{astep} system.
This algorithm design was handed over to the outdoor group that will implement it in the \gls{astep} system.
