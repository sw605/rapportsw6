Whereas the main topic of sprint 1 was an overall analysis and collaboration agreement, the topic of sprint 2 is design and development based on the results of sprint 1. The sprint intentions are to develop a route comparison algorithm that can be implemented in the aSTEP system, and to develop an app that has basic functionality, to be advanced and improved upon in sprint 3 and 4.

This chapter contains documentation of the analysis, design, implementation and test phases of the algorithm and app development performed in sprint 2.
