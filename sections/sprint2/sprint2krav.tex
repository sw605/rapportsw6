Sprint two is the first of the two middle sprints that have implementation as the primary focus. In this section, the main issues to be solved in the current iteration will be presented.

% algorithm
\textbf{Route Matching Algorithm}\\
In this sprint, the algorithm for comparing routes must be researched and developed. 
It should be developed to an extent so that it is constructed a pseudo code of the algorithm, to be handed over to another \gls{astep} group, and be implemented in the \gls{astep} system.

\textbf{User Data}\\
User information such as username, password, and login token, must be analyzed to figure out where this information should be stored, and how it should be handled regarding communication between the application and the aSTEP server. 

\textbf{RideShare app}\\
A base for the functionality for the \gls{rs} application should be implemented. 
The implementation should include a working implementation of the Google Play Services and the application should be able to collect and store location data. 
The application should also have functionality to run as a background services, so that location data can be collected at all times.

\textbf{System Architecture and Communication}\\
Communication between the \gls{rs} application and \gls{astep} server should also be researched and an implementation of the communication should be initialized in this iteration, ensuring the next iteration will have a base for communication. 
It should be considered how to handle storing the collected location data and how much should be stored where, either on the device or on the \gls{astep} server.

\textbf{Mock Data}\\
If there is spare time during the sprint, it should be considered to acquire mock up location data related to mock up users. 
This data could be used in the third iteration to test if the algorithm works as intended.
