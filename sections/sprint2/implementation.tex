\section{Implementation}
In this section we will document the initiating implementation of the \gls{rs} system, that has been designed until now. 
In this sprint the implementation of the location gathering as a background service will be documented.

\subsection{Route Matching Algorithm}\label{sec:routematchingalgorith}
The implementation of the route-matching algorithm is delegated to the previously mentioned outdoor location based service group, as they are responsible for implementation in the \gls{astep} system.
They were given the pseudocode algorithm developed in sprint 2 and cooperated with during the implementation process.
The implementation will not be documented here, as the actual implementation is not performed by us.
However, the implementation should be tested, and we generated test data with accompanying result expectations.
The test data was also handed over, this will be described in the following test section.

In cooperation with the outdoor group, it was decided to send every variable for the algorithm as parameters in the API call.
This was done so that we would have control over the algorithm to ensure it performed according to our expectations.
