Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.

A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.

Have fun with it. You can create anything that makes you happy. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Get tough with it, get strong. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.

Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.

Let your heart be your guide. And just raise cain. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.

Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Just use the old one inch brush. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.

It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Just make little strokes like that. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.
