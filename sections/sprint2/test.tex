You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.

The least little bit can do so much. This is the way you take out your flustrations. A little happy sunlight shining through there. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Learn when to stop.

This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it one canvas. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Everybody needs a friend. You can do it.

I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. There are no limits in this world. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.

Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Working it up and down, back and forth. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

Brown is such a nice color. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Only eight colors that you need.
