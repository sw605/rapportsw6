% Definition of APP responsibilities
The ridesharing service which is documented in this report utilizes the aSTEP system.
The aSTEP system can save the locations and route history which the will collect, however the application will need additional data storage to fullfill the set system requirements, therefore as can be seen on \ref{fig:s2systemdesign}, the application will require a additional server which stores this information.
