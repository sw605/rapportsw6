% Definition of APP responsibilities
The ridesharing service documented in this report utilizes the aSTEP system.
The aSTEP system can save locations and route history which the the rideshare application will collect, however the application will need additional data storage to fulfill the set system requirements, therefore as can be seen on \ref{fig:s2systemdesign}, the application will require a additional server which stores this information.
The rideshare server has two main purposes, firstly it should store additional information about the systems users and secondly it should store the score for already calculated scores between given stable routes.
Fetch route matches

% user management responsibilities
User interface for logging in, registering a new user, edit contact information.
Through RideShare server.

% location responsibilities
Provide aSTEP system with location data directly.



% Definition of RIDESHARE(TM) server responsibilities
RideShare server..

% user management responsibilities

Because the user management system in aSTEP does only provide anything but username and password, the contact information and other data is stored on the RideShare server.


% location responsibilities
Fetch route matches for each user and store.



% Definition of aSTEP system responsibilities
aSTEP...

% user management responsibilities
