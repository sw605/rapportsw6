\subsection{Communication/collaboration with aSTEP}
% What does the aSTEP system look like?
The aSTEP system's current design is consisting of an API that apps and other external devices can communicate with, and a backend with user management and location based services.

% What is stored in aSTEP
The aSTEP system will store information regarding location data, and only basic information of users. The relevant app data that is stored in the aSTEP system is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Location data (user, route, longitude, latitude, timestamp)
	\item Username
	\item Password
\end{itemize}

There is, however, no storing of information regarding the actual name, contact information nor profile picture for the user. This affects the app development, so that there must be an external server somehow, to store the mentioned data.
