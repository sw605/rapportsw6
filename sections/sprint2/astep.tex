\subsection{Communication/collaboration with aSTEP}
% meta
To be able to utilize the aSTEP system, the communication protocol and functions must be analyzed. 
The analysis is based on the current development and planning of the API and other functions.

% aSTEP organization - groups
The status and intended functions are established in collaboration with the other project groups responsible for the aSTEP system side of the development. 
The main groups involved are the user management group and outdoor location based services group.

% What does the aSTEP system look like?
The current design of the aSTEP system is consisting of an API that apps and other external devices can communicate with, and a backend with user management and location based services.


% What is stored in aSTEP
The aSTEP system will store information regarding location data, and only basic information of users. 
The data stored in the aSTEP system, relevant to this project solution, is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Location data, with userID, route, longitude, latitude and timestamp
	\item Username
	\item Password
\end{itemize}

The aSTEP user management system does not provide storing of data regarding the actual name, contact information nor profile picture for aSTEP users. 
%This affects the rideshare solution, as there must be an external unit to store the aforementioned attributes. 


% How to cummunicate with aSTEP
The communication with the aSTEP is done through a REST API over Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
Accordingly, the communication is performed on a request and response basis. 


% api functions
At the current stage of the development of aSTEP, the following API functions are available for user management and location services:
