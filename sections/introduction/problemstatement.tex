\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:probstat}
% Metatext
Sharing rides is advantageous in an economical and environmental sense, but it is made tedious and difficult due to the lack of knowledge of other people sharing the same or similar commute routes as explained in \cite{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}. This leads to the following problem statement.
