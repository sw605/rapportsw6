% Introduction - awesome first sentence
%Commuters are causing traffic jams in dense areas where people are traveling similar routes. \todo{this sentence isn't awesome at all - Claus}
People traveling the same route in different vehicles induce slower traffic and a heavier strain on the environment \cite{trafficJam}\cite{trafficEmissions}.
This project embarks on the task of informing the individual commuters of other commuters traveling a similar path, so that they can share vehicle.
If this project is successful, the reduced number of cars could reduce the CO$_2$ emissions caused by traffic and commuting.

\section{Project environment}
% Problem domain and environment
This project is part of the collaboration project, \gls{astep}, in the SW6F16 semester of Aalborg University.
The project's goal is to develop a location-based service with accompanying applications. 

% Semester project environment + sprint description
The \gls{astep} project was developed in ten teams with four members each over the span of four months.
The project was furthermore divided into sprints with each sprint spanning over four weeks, resulting in a total of four sprints.
The sprints are synchronization points of the project groups, and this report will contain documentation of each sprint chronologically.

The first sprint is intended for analysis and collaboration development, the second and third are development sprints, and the fourth is intended for testing and finalizing the development.
The ten project groups are assigned to their respective tasks, with seven project groups developing the core \gls{astep} service, while the remaining three groups are developing applications utilizing the system.

\section{Problem domain}
% Solution scope and definition
\gls{astep}'s planned functionality gave the idea of a large set of location data which a system could use to identify and help drivers and passengers with arranging ridesharing.
The solution's goal is to provide ridesharing suggestions to the users of the solution.
When referring to the term ridesharing in this report, it is referred to as the action of private persons sharing a car for the whole or a part of a route. 
This definition is covered by the terms carpool and ad-hoc ridesharing by \citet{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}.  

% Intention of the solution
The intention of this project is to develop an Android app that utilizes the \gls{astep} system for historical location data and arranging carpool style ridesharing.
The extent of such a project can be wide and therefore we early choose that the main focus will be to design and implement a basic system, which could be expanded upon in a potential future project.
The purpose of the solution is to propose appropriate candidates for ridesharing to the users of the app.
The project will include developing and implementing of an algorithm that assesses if two users of the system should be suggested for ridesharing.
Other parts of the application, such as graphical user interface, are not prioritized but are developed to be sufficiently functional for practical purposes and testing.

The potential benefits are social, environmental and economical, as described in \cite{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}.
The app allows people to meet each other and thus reduce the use of cars, gasoline and the load on the road system.
The app could also decrease problems such as traffic jam and thereby also be time-saving, and causing less frustration for the drivers.

The future aspect of this solution seems bright since it easily should be modifiable for future transportation needs, i.e. autonomous vehicles.

% Transition to problem statement
To formally define the problem, a problem statement will be constructed.
