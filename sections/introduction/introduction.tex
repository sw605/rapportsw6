\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.

I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Just beat the devil out of it. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.

Don't fight it, use what happens. Anyone can paint. In life you need colors.

All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Let's build an almighty mountain. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.

This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.

And just raise cain. We'll do another happy little painting. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.

This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Brown is such a nice color. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.


\section{Examples}
You can also have examples in your document such as in example~\ref{ex:simple_example}.
\begin{example}{An Example of an Example}
  \label{ex:simple_example}
  Here is an example with some math
  \begin{equation}
    0 = \exp(i\pi)+1\ .
  \end{equation}
  You can adjust the colour and the line width in the {\tt macros.tex} file.

\section{How Does Sections, Subsections, and Subsections Look?}
Well, like this
\subsection{This is a Subsection}
and this
\subsubsection{This is a Subsubsection}
and this.

\paragraph{A Paragraph}
You can also use paragraph titles which look like this.

\subparagraph{A Subparagraph} Moreover, you can also use subparagraph titles which look like this\todo{Is it possible to add a subsubparagraph?}. They have a small indentation as opposed to the paragraph titles.

\todo[inline,color=green]{I think that a summary of this exciting chapter should be added.}
