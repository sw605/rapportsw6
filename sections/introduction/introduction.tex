% Introduction - awesome first sentence
Commuters are causing traffic jams in dense areas traveling similar routes, this project embarks the task of informing the individual commuters of other commuters traveling a similar path, so that they could share vehicle.
A such task also seeks to reduce the commuters impact on the environment.


\section{Project environment}
% Problem domain and environment
This project is part of a collaboration project, aSTEP, of the SW6F16 semester.
The semester goal is to develop a location based service with accompanying applications that utilizes the service. 

% Semester project environment
The aSTEP project is developed in 10 teams in the span of 4 sprints.
The sprints are synchronization points of the project groups, and this report will contain documentation of each sprint chronologically.
The 10 project groups are assigned to their respective tasks, with 7 project groups developing the core aSTEP service, while the remaining 3 are developing applications utilizing the system.


\section{Problem domain}
% Solution scope and definition
The problem domain of this project is to design and develop a solution which utilize the aSTEP system, and can identify and help drivers and passengers with arranging ridesharing.
The solution's goal is to provide ridesharing suggestions to the users of the solution. 

% Intention of the solution
The solution's intention is to generate matches of ride sharing companions, and notify the respective drivers and passengers of the match, enabling them to contact each other and share rides.
The matches should be custom made for each user, i.e. proposing appropriate candidates for ride sharing, which will be defined later.

The project focus is to develop an algorithm that can be utilized to assess a score of a match, hence enabling the solution to propose the appropriate candidates. The graphical user interface is not prioritized, but is developed to be functional enough for test and practical purposes.

% Solution contributions/advantages
A solution that automatically provides ride suggestions to both drivers and passengers, could be beneficial for the users in several ways. There could be environmental and economical savings, as the number of polluting cars driven is reduced as described in \cite{doi:10.1080/01441647.2011.621557}. The app could cause less traffic jam, thereby also being time-saving, and causing less frustration for the drivers.

There are some potential social benefits, as the app allows people meet each other. Future work could implement the algorithm for autonomous cars.\todo{make sure all above doesn't get to low level. Make it general.}

% Temp. shit
\iffalse
Since employers usually are located in the same area, and commuters could live in the same area, there should be a possibility for the commuters  potentially share cars and thereby reduce traffic.
There are many apps\todo{source and define 'app'} that allow users to request and give rides\todo{define}, but they require active participation of the users to do so.

% Transition to problem statement
To define the actual problem, as to initiate the research and development, a concrete formulation is made.
