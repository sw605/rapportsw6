It is a known fact that commuters are causing traffic jams in dense areas, and this semester project embarks the task of informing the individual commuters of other commuters traveling a similar path, so that they could share transportation. 
%Since employers usually are located in the same area, and commuters could live in the same area, there should be a possibility for the commuters  potentially share cars and thereby reduce traffic.
%There are many apps\todo{source and define 'app'} that allow users to request and give rides\todo{define}, but they require active participation of the users to do so. 
An automatic solution that provides ride suggestions to both drivers and passengers, would be beneficial for the users.
