\section{Analysis}
% metatext
This analysis section contains analysis of the previous sprint with the intention of improving the solution, and considerations of further development of \gls{rs}.
Additionally, because the \gls{astep} system is in development and the \gls{rs} solution is dependent on its status, the \gls{astep} will be examined for changes and additions.

First, the location gathering will be investigated, followed by an examination of the current configuration of the \gls{astep} system.
