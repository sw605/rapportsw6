%meta - to edit
The third sprint is deemed to satisfy the requirements not met in the previous sprints.
The app is currently a working template and can instantiate a background service, but is not completed. 
The background service redesign and implementation is the main focus of this sprint, together with the route matching algorithm testing.

% something
\textbf{Location gathering as a background service}\\
The original requirement of location gathering was not fulfilled by the implementation in sprint 2, thus it must be reimplemented.
The background service should be sensitive to the users current activity and only record locations when the user is driving.

\textbf{Conclude the route matching algorithm through test and collaboration}\\
The route matching algorithm was designed in sprint 2 and delivered to the outdoor group\todo{clarify?} responsible for the implementation in \gls{astep}.
The algorithm is supposed to be implemented within this sprint, and the implementation should be tested for ability to produce results and correctness.
The testing must be done with some test data, along with result expectations.
