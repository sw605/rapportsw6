The third sprint is will be used to satisfy the requirements not met in the previous sprint.
The app is currently a working template and can instantiate a background service, but is not completed. 
The background service redesign and implementation are the main focus of this sprint, together with some testing of the implementation of the route-matching algorithm.

% something
\textbf{Location Gathering as a Background Service}\\
The original requirement of location gathering was not fulfilled by the implementation in sprint 2, thus, it must be reimplemented.
The background service should be sensitive to the user's current activity and only record locations when the user is driving.

\textbf{Conclude the Route Matching Algorithm Through Test and Collaboration}\\
The route-matching algorithm was designed in sprint 2 and handed over to the outdoor group responsible for the implementation in \gls{astep}.
The algorithm is supposed to be implemented within this sprint, and the implementation should be tested for result correctness.
The testing must be done with some test data, along with result expectations.
