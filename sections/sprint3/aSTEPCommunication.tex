This section will describe how the communication between the \gls{rs} system and the aSTEP system is handled.
And how features from the aSTEP API is used to achieve the desired outcomes.

The aSTEP API is as described in Section \ref{ssec:communicationwithastep} is a REST API over HTTP. 
This means that all API calls are done through HTTP requests.

An overview of all the possible HTTP-request was public available at \url{http://www.astep.cs.aau.dk/} on the 5\textsuperscript{th} of May 2016.
We will only be using a subset of the features presented to us, those being; Locations, Routes, Users, and some way to allow \gls{rs} to access the data from the aSTEP server for its users.
In the API there are two ways of doing this; by creating a group for all the app users or by having an edge from a seperate \gls{rs}-user to every aSTEP-user that uses the app.

We will spend a few lines to describe why we decided to use edges instead of groups:

\paragraph{Groups} in the aSTEP program exists to allow users to gain access to eachothers data.
This could be used by making a user for the \gls{rs} system where all users who uses the app is included in.
The problem with this is that all users have now granted access to their local data to anyone how happens to use the same app, regardless of the context. 
This means that a malicios programmer could create a program that plots the locations of all users of the \gls{rs} app.
They would only need a new user registered as using the \gls{rs} app and would there for be included in the group.

	\caption{How the \gls{rs}-system would use gropus. In the red group (the red circle) all users in that group can see all data from other users in the same group.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Edges} works is a similar way to groups but instead of granting all users access to every other users data, the edges only allow access from one user to another.
Using the same method of establishing communication as with the groups we create a \gls{rs}-user and creates a edge from that user to every user that uses the \gls{rs} system.
This way it is only when the \gls{rs} system uses its own user it is allowed to access data from the users.

	\begin{tikzpicture}

		\node[below of=r] (1) {$U_1$};
		\node[right of=1](2) {$U_2$};
		\node[left of=1] (4) {$U_4$};
		\node[right of=2] (5) {$U_5$};
		\node[left of=4] (6) {$U_6$};

		\draw[->] (1) -- (4);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\label{fig:astepgroup}
	\caption{How the \gls{rs}-system would work with edges.}
\end{figure}

This means that edges can provide the same benifits without opening the same security flaws.
Therefor the edges is determined to be the superior system.

This means that we can determine the API calls required by the \gls{rs}-system.
An overview of those can be seen on Table \ref{tab:asteprequests}.
