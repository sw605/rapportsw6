\section{Implementation}
The implementation section contains descriptions of selected parts of the implementation performed in sprint 3.

The main focus is the location gathering service, which will record locations continuously while the user is driving, but not otherwise. 

\subsection{Location Gathering Background service}
% metatext
This subsection will describe the contents of the implementation of the background location gathering.
The new implementation is founded on the poor results of the location gathering method implemented in sprint 2, Section \ref{section:locationgathering}, that was not working as intended.
The code examples in this section will not include potential logging and debugging lines as for better readability and they do not influence the functionality of the code.

\textbf{Implementation plan}\\
According to the design, Section \ref{section:s3locgath}, the locations should first be requested when the user is driving.
Therefore, the implementation starts by instantiating an activity detector.
The activity detector can thereafter check the received activity, and begin location gathering if the activity is above a confidence threshold for driving activity.
When the confidence is lower than the threshold for a period of time, the driving activity can be considered finished, and the route must be stored and later transmitted to the \gls{astep} system.


% activityRecognitionInstantiation
\textbf{Activity recognition instantiation}\\
The location gathering should first detect that the device is in a driving activity and then begin recording locations, according to the design described in Section \ref{ssec:LocationGatherBGS}.
To achieve the functionality, the app must connect to a Google API client and subscribe to activity recognition.
The code for subscribing to the activity recognition is shown in Listing \ref{activityRecognitionInstantiation}.
The activity recognition can thereafter check that the detected activity is a driving activity, and accordingly activate the location gathering.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, label=activityRecognitionInstantiation, caption=Initialization of activity recognition.]
if(activityDetectionBroadcastReceiver == null) {
	activityDetectionBroadcastReceiver = 
		new ActivityDetectionBroadcastReceiver(googleApiClient, this);
		
	LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(
		activityDetectionBroadcastReceiver, 
		new IntentFilter("fapptory_inc.rideshare.BROADCAST_ACTION"));
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{activityDetectionBroadcastReceiver} is an instantiation of the\\ \texttt{ActivityDetectionBroadcastReceiver} class from, utilizing the \texttt{googleApiClient} and \texttt{this} which in this case references the current \texttt{MainActivity} instance to broadcast detected activities.

The broadcast receiver is then applied by registering to the \gls{rs} app's\\ \texttt{BROADCAST\_ACTION}, so that the \texttt{activityDetectionBroadcastReceiver} only handles broadcasts sent by \gls{rs} and not by other apps.

% ActivityIntentService broadcast description



% Activity Detection Broadcast Receiver
\textbf{Activity Detection Broadcast Receiver}\\
The main operations in regards to activity detection and location gathering are done by the activity detection broadcast receiver.

When the \texttt{activityDetectionBroadcastReceiver} receives a RideShare broadcast, the extra data in the broadcast is stored in the \texttt{ArrayList<DetectedActivity> detectedActivities}.
The \texttt{detectedActivities} is iterated over, shown in Listing \ref{activityRecognitionIteration} to find the driving activity \texttt{DetectedActivity.IN\_VEHICLE}.
The \texttt{startLocationUpdates()}, which is described later, is called if the confidence is above the threshold and if locations are not currently being recorded.
Line 8 controls the location cache in case a drive is stopped temporarily and starts again, appending the cached route to the actual route.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, label=activityRecognitionIteration, caption=Iteration over received list of activity recognition.]
for (DetectedActivity da: detectedActivities){
	if(da.getType() == DetectedActivity.IN_VEHICLE){
		if(da.getConfidence() >= ACTIVITY_CONFIDENCE_VALUE){
			if(!isCurrentlyCollectingLocations) {
				startLocationUpdates();
				isCurrentlyCollectingLocations = true;
			}
			if(potentialStopDrivingActivity && potentialAstepRoute.size() > 0){
				astepRoute.addAll(astepRoute.size(), potentialAstepRoute);
				potentialAstepRoute.clear();
			}
			lastDetectedVehicleActivity = System.currentTimeMillis();
			potentialStopDrivingActivity = false;
			drivingActivityDetected = true;
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

% Location Updates Request
\textbf{Location Updates Request}\\
The \texttt{startLocationUpdates()}, shown in Listing \ref{startLocationUpdates}, is called to gather locations regularly.
The location updates request is based on the Google API client instantiated in \texttt{MainActivity} and a \texttt{locationRequest}.
The \texttt{locationRequest} is defined with properties regarding location update interval, fastest interval, and location quality priority, respectively set to \todo{agree upon constants} 60 seconds, 120 seconds and \texttt{PRIORITY\_HIGH\_ACCURACY}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, label=startLocationUpdates, caption=Start location updates functions.]
public void startLocationUpdates(){
	if(/* Omitted: Check permissions */) {
		LocationServices.FusedLocationApi
			.requestLocationUpdates(googleApiClient, locationRequest, this);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

To send the routes gathered through the location service, the communication with \gls{astep} must be established.
