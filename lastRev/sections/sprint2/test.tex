\section{Test}
The test performed in this sprint was regarding the location gathering.
The implementation of the jobScheduler made it impossible for the \texttt{GoogleApiClient} to connect, hence not being able to assess the device location.
Additionally, the interval based location gathering, would be using battery consequently, regardless of the activity of the user. 
It is preferable to activate GPS locationing feature as little as possible, because GPS location is battery consuming.
