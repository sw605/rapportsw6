Whereas the main topic of sprint 1 was an overall analysis and collaboration agreement, the topic of sprint 2 is design and development based on the results of sprint 1. The sprint intentions are to develop a route comparison algorithm that can be implemented in the aSTEP system, and to develop an app that has basic functionality, to be advanced and improved upon in sprint 3.

This chapter contains documentation of the analysis, design, implementation and test phases of the algorithm and app development performed in sprint 2.
