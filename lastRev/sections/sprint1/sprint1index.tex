\chapter{Sprint 1}
The first sprint concerns with getting the project started, both the aSTEP project as a whole and the ridesharing project described in this chapter.
Thus the first sprint will be spent on organizing the collaboration with the other project groups and setting the direction for the project.
This means that the two contributing parts of sprint 1 will be the initial analysis and overall design.
